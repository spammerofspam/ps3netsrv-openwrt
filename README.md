# UDPBD Server for OpenWRT

[![CI](https://github.com/spammerofspam/ps3netsrv-openwrt/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/spammerofspam/ps3netsrv-openwrt/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This is a decidedly WIP repo for building the UDPBD server. This one was taken from the repo at https://github.com/4gordi/udpbd-server. AFAIK all the ones floating around are variants of the same origin (that seems to not have a license?).
